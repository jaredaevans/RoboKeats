# RoboKeats

John Keats was a prolific Romantic poet. Alongside Byron and Shelley, Keats is widely regarded as one of the most influencial from the second generation of Romantic.  His career was extraordinary, especially considering its brevity - he died from tuberculosis at age 25.  Though he was not well known in his lifetime, his potent prose has inspired generations of others and brought him to deserved fame.  That he produced so much memorable work in his lifetime brings many, inclusing myself, to wonder what he might have achieved if only blessed with more time.  This is my foolhardy attempt to continue his works. :)

## Character-based 

Using a simple LSTM network and Keats existing work, this program tries to mimic Keats words from text seeds at the character level

Sample:  
 of piller hand the fearful about the water  
 the gooding did a cure it linger pale  
 of the weary fearful but be grown hours  
 and on the morning sullen like more  
 and there delight viice would be divine  
 on  his press'd the from lot his ragic felt  
 'tis heart known man powers of the river death  
 are all the were my splendours she stattle years  
 young green prisow'd ilve on roses delight  
 with sicken or from we great his on her idling   
 
 the silver in her as a flowers with a slow  
 and contente will i courses in the rear'd  
 to this summer sick the bloom unto the mark  
 upon his song and bursting and she stood  
 the wind the frights and so fair pass  
 to see the friends in her these shade and strange  
 the feel the through the breathless in archies  
 who there is the child winter in the sad look  
 the summer pity the from the fair day  
 and the lake of the forest white happy round  
 and bright of flowers to the corn to tears  
 the breathless still the dews and shepherd  


With a higher temperature, RoboKeats quickly starts to sound more like Lewis Carroll:  
 o to tawne wrodes had colome at last  
 a deathy whine shadies night and sweet  
 or beened and sthed nest as 'twas know ping and flool  
 rought shelpless enwant from the unlaving lore  
 felt beam roof look robble to the troo'd  
 whene fronted on h it without those mountain  
 save he od aa slumber and said her brightes  
 have in mild and wavy few thy calip  
 thy signon bull once he water unbendless  
 to conuming through a moant forth  
 alas this in the from for her sulser sun  
 tile war on haught and bright winder kwisst blow
