# RoboKeats

John Keats was a prolific Romantic poet. Alongside Byron and Shelley, Keats is widely regarded as one of the most influencial from the second generation of Romantic.  His career was extraordinary, especially considering its brevity - he died from tuberculosis at age 25.  Though he was not well known in his lifetime, his potent prose has inspired generations of others and brought him to deserved fame.  That he produced so much memorable work in his lifetime brings many, inclusing myself, to wonder what he might have achieved if only blessed with more time.  This is my foolhardy attempt to continue his works. :)

## Character-based 

Using a simple LSTM network and Keats existing work, this program tries to mimic Keats words from text seeds at the character level

Sample:  
 the first more little shades for since  
 and a feeling soul with side  
 the bright cruel arm charm'd upon  
 and felt he can not charmed  
 on the old than and white dead  
 dear so more in her stars made  
 to her stars of bright again  
 the said great the leaves beauty  
 strive the bright and spread more shade  
 for cares he stood he poor speak of a shade  
 in each faint my day no more closed smile  
 would i strange love sparkling fair and streams  
 the mouth of orge many a wander to string  
 perching my blood with pillow hard muse were there  


With a higher temperature, RoboKeats quickly starts to sound more like Lewis Carroll:  
 o to tawne wrodes had colome at last  
 a deathy whine shadies night and sweet  
 or beened and sthed nest as 'twas know ping and flool  
 rought shelpless enwant from the unlaving lore  
 felt beam roof look robble to the troo'd  
 whene fronted on h it without those mountain  
 save he od aa slumber and said her brightes  
 have in mild and wavy few thy calip  
 thy signon bull once he water unbendless  
 to conuming through a moant forth  
 alas this in the from for her sulser sun  
 tile war on haught and bright winder kwisst blow
